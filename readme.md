## GitHub Pages Tutorial

Welcome to the GitHub Pages Tutorial!

With a text editor and the GitHub Desktop, you can start your own personal website on GitHub. Bring your laptop and we'll explore the fun world of GitHub Pages!

## What You Need to Start

You don't need to know how to code to setup a GitHub page. We'll learn some Markdown basics

+ [A GitHub Account](https://github.com/join?source=header-home)
+ [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
+ Text Editor (we prefer [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com), but [Atom](https://atom.io) is also good)
+ File Manager (to rename files)
    + Windows Explorer or Mac OS Finder (whatever you have)
+ Something to say
+ Pictures (optional)

You may want to spend a little time learning how to use markdown, as it'll make putting your content together faster. There is a tutorial here: [The Magic of Markdown](https://github.com/laderast/magic-of-markdown/blob/master/magic-of-markdown.md)
