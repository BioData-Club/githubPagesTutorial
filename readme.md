## What You Need to Start

+ [A GitHub Account](https://github.com/join?source=header-home)
+ [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
+ Text Editor (we prefer [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com), but [Atom](https://atom.io) is also good)

    + Windows Explorer or Mac OS Finder (whatever you have)

You may want to spend a little time learning how to use markdown, as it'll make putting your content together faster. There is a tutorial here: [The Magic of Markdown](https://github.com/laderast/magic-of-markdown/blob/master/magic-of-markdown.md)

## Getting Started

If you want to use GitHub Desktop, open up `intermediate/githubPagesTutorial.pdf`. Then it's just a matter of following directions. 

Our easier version is available in the `easy` folder and also at: https://biodata-club.github.io/githubPagesTutorial/easy/ It only requires a laptop and a GitHub account.

Be sure to use your Post-Its if you're stuck and one of us will help you.
