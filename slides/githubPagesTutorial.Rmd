## What is GitHub Pages?

GitHub Pages is a built-in system that allows you to build websites directly from a GitHub Repository.

There are two kinds of GitHub pages:

+ Personal websites (associated with an account)
+ Repository Specific Websites (webpages for software)

## What You Need for Today

You don't need to know how to code to setup a GitHub page. We'll learn some Markdown basics

+ GitHub Account
+ GitHub Desktop
+ Text Editor (Sublime, Atom, TextEdit)
+ File Manager (to rename files)
+ Something to say
+ Pictures (optional)

## Why GitHub Pages?

GitHub is a highly dependable webhost, and you get one personal webpage account for free. 

Because GitHub pages is compatible with markdown, we'll be using markdown formatting to build our webpage.

## Our goal for the day

We're going to build a personal webpage which will live at USERNAME.github.io, and have blogging features and will be easily customizable. 

## What We're Going to do Today

  1) Download this repo
  2) Make a local repo with the `websiteFolder`
  3) Change and Personalize Your Site with YAML
  4) Publish your Repo to GitHub
  5) Look at your pretty website!
  6) Start Editing Content
  7) Add a Blog Post
  8) Customize your sidebar
  9) Look at your pretty website!

## Download the Repo

Clone the the repo at: https://github.com/BioData-Club/githubPagesTutorial/ (click the "Clone or Download" button to open it in your GitHub Desktop).

Using a file manager, take out the `websiteFiles` folder and rename it to USERNAME.github.io, where USERNAME is your GitHub username.

I like to have a code specific folder to store my code, such as "c:/code/" (windows) or "~/Code/" (Mac/Linux) so that it has a permanent place to stay. This will be important when you push changes to your website. So create a code-specific folder and put the USERNAME.github.io folder in it.

In GitHub Desktop add the repo using the "+" symbol and use the "Add" tab to add your folder. "Publish" the folder to GitHub using the "Publish" button. 

## Let's Make a Personal Webpage

Once you've published the repository, try your personal webpage: http://USERNAME.github.io

Now we'll start customizing it.

## Editing the Name of Your Webpage and Customizing

The first step to customizing your webpage is to edit the blogs name to 
include your information. You'll open the `_config.yml` file to update
the info. Change the *title*, *tagline*, *description*, and *url* fields.

Here's an example `_config.yml` file.

```
# Personalize your website info here
title:            Anew Guy
tagline:          'Professional Website for Anew Guy'
description:      'Website and Blog for Anew Guy'
url:              http://anewguy.github.io
author:
  name:           'Anew Guy'
  url:            https://twitter.com/anewguy
```

## Markdown and Index.md

Anything with index.md will be automatically translated and served as a webpage.

Using Jekyll, you can add header and footers and other templating features, standardizing the look of your pages as you like.

One thing to remember is when your output is HTML, so you can embed HTML tags, which is especially useful for embedding images, since you can adjust image size directly within the tag.

## Let's Add Some Links

Links, or URLs and web addresses, you see on websites can link to other webpages.

In your index.md file, you can add a link by enclosing the text for your link in square brackets (`[text here]`) and the underlying link in parentheses (`(http://link-here.com)`) right next to it. So altogether, it should look like this: 

```
[link to Google](https://www.google.com)
```

## Let's Add an Image

You can also add images to your webpage. GitHub has a mascot called Octocat, so let's add a picture of one to our site. Similar to how we added a link, you just need to add an exclamation mark in front of the square bracket and parentheses.

An example looks like this 

```
![Jetpacktocat](https://octodex.github.com/images/jetpacktocat.png)
```

**Note**: the text within the square brackets should generally be a description of image, but you can leave it blank if you want so the following would also work.

```
![](https://octodex.github.com/images/jetpacktocat.png)
```

## Add a Blog Entry

Your current repository is setup for blog entries. In your newly renamed `websiteFiles/` folder, you'll find another folder named `_posts`. This is where you'll put new blog posts.

Each post you make should be in the form `YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.md`, so for example, `2017-04-21-github-pages-tutorial.md`. You'll also want a `.yaml`-like text near the top.

```
---
layout: post
title: Awesome Blog Post
---
```

## Modifying the Menu

If you take a look at the example site, https://biodata-club.github.io/githubPagesTutorial/, you'll notice a menu side bar on the left. Near the bottom left corner, you'll see links to other pages on the site. We can add and remove these links and their respective pages fairly easily.

Looking at the files in your main directory (which are the contents from `websiteFiles/`), the menu is automatically generated based on the files that end in `.md` (except `LICENSE.md` and `README.md`). If you take a look, you can see `about.md`, `cv.md`, and `about.md`. Similarly named links should be in the menu.

To create a new page, you need to have the following at the top and just change the text for the title.

```
---
layout: page
title: About
---
```

## GitHub Pages

Another nice use of Markdown is for authoring websites. You can do this really easily with GitHub pages.

GitHub Pages uses an HTML translation engine called *Jekyll*, which is written in Ruby to translate Markdown into HTML. You don't really need to know about it, unless you want to use the templating in Jekyll to build something like a blog.

One benefit to using Jekyll is that it's a relatively lightweight way to manage a blog without a more complicated, database-using, content management system. Because of this, it's relatively portable and you can easily take your documents with you if you decide to migrate to another system.

## Markdown and GitHub pages

Any markdown file that has an .markdown or .md extension will automatically be processed by GitHub and served as a html page. For example: https://github.com/laderast/magic-of-markdown/blob/master/magic-of-markdown.md

If you want to make a webpage for your code, you need to create a branch called `gh-pages` and put the markdown files in there. I believe you can also just place html files as well.

## Jekyll File Structure

If you're interested in setting up a blog or more complicated site, you'll have to learn a little bit about Jekyll and the [liquid templating](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/templates/) language.

You can download Jekyll by itself to see how it transforms markdown files, but to get started with a blog or pages, it's actually way easier to [clone Poole](https://github.com/poole/poole), which gives you the basic file structure that you can use to serve the GitHub pages.
